# \[8] 11 - Felon in Possession of a Firearm

A person may not store or leave a loaded firearm where, in good faith, that same person knew or should have known that an unsupervised child could potentially gain access to the firearm. Firearms should be kept in safes, or locked with industry standard security devices, if they are to be left in such conditions.&#x20;
