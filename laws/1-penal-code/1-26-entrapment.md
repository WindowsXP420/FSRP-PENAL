# \[1] 26 - Entrapment

It is illegal for a law enforcement officer to coerce a person to commit a crime, through great pressure or overbearing/behaviorally-dominant actions.&#x20;

Entrapment is: to encourage the conduction of a crime which would have otherwise been not committed by that individual.

The mere act of entrapment may invalidate an entire criminal charge as well as bring into question the ethicality of the investigation and individual officers.&#x20;
