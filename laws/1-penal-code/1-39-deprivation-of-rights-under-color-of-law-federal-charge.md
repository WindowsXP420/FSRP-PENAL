# \[1] 39 - Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law (Federal Charge)

It is a crime for a person acting under color of any law to willfully deprive a person of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution or laws of San Andreas.

For the purpose of this law, acts under "color of law" include acts not only done by federal, state, or local officials within their lawful authority, but also acts done beyond the bounds of that official's lawful authority, if the acts are done while the official is purporting to or pretending to act in the performance of his/her official duties. Persons acting under color of law within the meaning of this statute include police officers, prisons guards and other law enforcement officials, as well as judges, care providers in public health facilities, and others who are acting as public officials. It is not necessary that the crime be motivated by animus toward the race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin of the victim.
