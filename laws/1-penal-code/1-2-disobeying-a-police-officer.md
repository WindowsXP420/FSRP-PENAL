{% hint style="danger" %}
**Misdemeanor**

**Sentence:** 100 Seconds \
**Fine:** $100
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Disobeying a Police Officer is not something that you can just tack on to whoever doesn't listen to you. There needs to be a legal (or interest of life, death, or public safety) reason for you to hit someone with this charge. You cannot just make up a law or reason, tell someone to do something, then arrest them for Disobeying when they refuse to comply.

May not stack with Resisting Arrest.
