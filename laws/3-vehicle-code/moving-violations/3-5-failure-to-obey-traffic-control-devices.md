# \[3] 5 - Failure to Obey Traffic Control Devices

Drivers must obey posted regulatory signs and traffic signals (e.g. Stop sign, yield sign, red light, no turn sign, etc.).

At a stop sign, drivers must stop, yield to pedestrians, yield to other drivers who arrived at the intersection's limit-lines before them, and then proceed.&#x20;

At a red traffic light, drivers must stop until the light changes to green.&#x20;

* Performing a right turn during a red light is permitted after a full stop, and after yielding to all other traffic and pedestrians.&#x20;
* Performing a left turn during a red light is permitted if turning from a one-way street onto a one or two-way street after a full stop, and after yielding to all other traffic and pedestrians.&#x20;

At a railway level-crossing, drivers and pedestrians must stop behind the bar-gate while the barrier is lowered and the red-warning lights are flashing; traversing beyond or around the lowered barrier is prohibited. Drivers and pedestrians may proceed after the gate is raised and the flashing lights turn off. At level-crossings without barriers and lights, drivers and pedestrians shall yield if a train is visibly proceeding towards them.

During an unprotected right turn, drivers must yield to pedestrians.

During an unprotected left turn, drivers must yield to oncoming traffic as well as pedestrians.

Drivers must yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks. Drivers may not proceed through the crosswalk until the crosswalk is vacated OR until all pedestrians have crossed to the opposite lanes of travel AND are not walking towards the driver's path.
