# \[3] 34 - Bicycle Lane Usage

If a bicycle lane or sidewalk is open and available, it must be used by cyclists. Riding a bicycle on a public road where a sidewalk or bicycle lane is open and available is a violation.&#x20;

In the event of no bicycle lane or sidewalk being available (such as in the area of Sandy Shores), a cyclist is entitled to utilize a full lane of traffic.&#x20;
