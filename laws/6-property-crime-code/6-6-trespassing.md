# \[6] 6 - Trespassing

A person who knowingly enters or remains unlawfully on private or government property.

* Implied Public Area: An implicitly public area is an area that is private property but functions as a public area (ex. shopping area of a store, fueling-up area of a gas station, lobby of a police station). To trespass someone from an implicitly-public-area within private property, the individual must first be ordered to leave by an authority within the property (ex. Manager, Property Owner); upon return or refusal to leave, the person may be arrested.
* Restricted Area: Restricted areas are implicitly or explicitly defined. They include areas which have posted keep-out or no-trespassing signage as well as secured areas which are fenced, walled off, or behind doorways. Unauthorized persons may be arrested on the spot.&#x20;
* Residences: Homes and apartment buildings are personal spaces which may only be accessed by residents, property owners, and invited guests. Any presence on private residences and land without authorization may be cause for arrest.&#x20;
