**Examples:**

**1)** Sending a text message from your phone while driving, resulting in hitting a bicyclist and kill him; \
**2)** A teenager is speeding on the highway when he crashes into another car, killing that driver.\
**3)** A man deliberately drives into a stop sign at high speed in the hopes of getting an insurance payout for his car, and in doing so he hits and kills a pedestrian.
