**Federal Law Enforcement**\

Federal (National) Law Enforcement Agencies are hereby granted the authority to operate within the state of San Andreas, including abilities such as - but not limited to - search and seizure of properties located within the state (assuming proper legal procedures have been met and said actions have been deemed justified), investigations involving violations of state law, pursuit and apprehension of a person(s) deemed to be a “suspect” of a breach of the law, maintaining public order, enforcing federal laws, issuing citations, pressing charges, arresting individuals, and requesting assistance from or assisting state agencies.

Federal Law Enforcement Agencies: U.S. Marshals (local and federal authority), United States Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (United States Coast Guard, Terrorist Task Force, Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Federal Protective Service, etc.), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), International Affairs Agency (CIA/IAA), Drug Observation Agency (DEA/DOA), National Guard and Military Police.

**Federal and Local Law Enforcement Jurisdiction Overlap**

* Federally sworn officers may engage in matters that concern public safety, particularly during exigent circumstances. Those incidents which occur in a particularly close vicinity to their jurisdiction, or which present a great amount of danger, even if it may not pertain directly to their legal jurisdiction, may induce involvement in the interest of public safety, well-being, and justice. Federal officers possess certain limited authority and may enforce laws such as traffic violations on access roads or areas adjacent to federal property.&#x20;
  * Example: A Federal officer may respond to a bad car accident which occurred in front of the FBI building. Although they do not possess direct legal authority, they may still act as a trained first responder acting in the interest of public safety.&#x20;
  * Example: A federal officer may perform a traffic stop for reckless driving in exigent circumstances; a federal officer witnesses a suspected drunk driver on a freeway and chooses to detain the driver. This may be construed as a citizen's arrest and/or an example of mutual aid.&#x20;
* Local law enforcement officers may also engage in incidents which pose a great amount of danger, even if they may not pertain directly to their legal jurisdiction and are occurring on federal property.&#x20;
  *   Example: A Local Officer may respond to a fight in the FBI building, even if it is Federal Property.

      Although they do not possess direct legal authority, they may still act as a trained first responder acting in the interest of public safety.&#x20;

**Emergency High Crime Census Act**

The Governor of Missouri may declare areas "high crime zones." Such declaration shall authorize federal agencies to perform law enforcement activity with the specific goal of reducing violent and dangerous crime. The Department of Justice shall be responsible for protecting the rights of citizens residing within these zones and must see to it that the Governor does not abuse this authority.&#x20;
