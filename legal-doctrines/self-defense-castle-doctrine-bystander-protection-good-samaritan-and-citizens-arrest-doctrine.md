# Self Defense, Castle Doctrine, Bystander Protection, Good Samaritan, and Citizen's Arrest Doctrine

The Self Defense doctrine contains guidelines relating to the justification and legality of the use of deadly force in the defense of one's own person, their property, or their surroundings by a civilian.&#x20;

**Standing Ones Ground**

A civilian, when faced with the threat of violence, injury, or loss of property is not required to flee. Civilians have no duty to retreat from a threat of violence, injury, or theft/burglary/robbery when in the act of defending ones self. When faced with a threat of violence, injury, or loss of property a civilian may defend themselves up to and including the use of lethal force to stop the threat against them.

**Bystander Protection, Good Samaritans, and Citizen's Arrest**

In accordance with Felony Vigilantism, "performing the duties of law enforcement without the legal authority to do so" is illegal; With this principle already established, it is legally recognized through this doctrine that civilians may intervene to protect the life and/or property of another civilian if they are bearing direct witness to a misdemeanor or felony involving the threat of violence or loss of property against said individual (this may also be referred to as a "Citizen's arrest" if the action-taken involved the act of preventing the suspect from leaving).&#x20;

**Castle Doctrine**

When a resident is faced with the threat of violence, injury, or loss/damage to ones property while on their own property or in their own legal residence, the resident has no duty to retreat and may use force against intruders who \[attempt to] break into their homes, \[attempt to] steal or damage their property, or who chronically trespass
