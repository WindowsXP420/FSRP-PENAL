# Capital Punishment Doctrine

****\
****Within this document are the legal authorities granted by the Justice Department of the State of San Andreas, such institutions of this doctrine upon an individual shall be done by a judge in a court of law under circumstances of extreme discrepancies. To begin the process of Capital Punishment, the prosecution/charging officer must file a case with the Justice Department and specifically request “Capital Punishment.”\
\
This doctrine grants the Justice Department the authority to execute a person convicted of multiple prior felony charges involving murder(s), while presently being charged with additional felony murder(s), to be given “Capital Punishment**.**”&#x20;

Previous convictions of murder may be used as a part of the justification for “Capital Punishment” but they are not to be retried during a new trial for new murder charges related to a request for “Capital Punishment.”\
\
Execution: To be carried out by bailiffs shortly after the sentencing and done by no less than three bailiffs, using rifles in a standing line formation. All rifles shall fire at the same time into the individual until such individual is found to be “deceased,” thus completing the process.

**Implication: This will result in a permanent character death by server rule**
